An ultrasonic sensor uses sound waves to measure distance. It emits high-frequency ultrasonic waves and detects the time it takes for the waves to bounce back after hitting an object. By calculating the time of flight, the sensor can determine the distance between itself and the object. Ultrasonic sensors are popular in robotics, automation, and security systems. They offer non-contact, accurate, and reliable distance measurement capabilities.
